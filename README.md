CSE 572 - Data Mining

I comepleted the _CSE 572: Data Mining_ course at ASU. The course introduced fundamental concepts and techniques in data mining, including classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and outlier detection. Throughout the course, I not only learned the theoretical aspects of these topics but also gained hands-on experience by implementing data mining techniques and applying them to real-world data. The course also provided insights into how data mining is used in research, enhancing my understanding and practice of the complete research process.

This repo consists of all the labs and homeworks that I completed for the successful completion of the course.

**_Labs_**:

Lab 1 - covers a review of python, numpy, and pandas fundamentals, functions, and syntax.

Lab 2 - Covers topics from Data Exploration module.

Lab 3 - Contains a practice of implementing data preparation techniques including sampling, splitting, discretization, and scaling transforms. 

Lab 4 - Contains a practice exercise implementing decision trees and random forests, and provides an implementation of dataset split.

Lab 5 - Contains a practice implementing different variations of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

Lab 6 - Contains a practice implementing different variations of the Neural Network classifier.

Lab 7 - Covers a practice implementing the K-means clustering technique.

Lab 8 - Contains a practice implementing techniques for dimensionality reduction using (Kernel) PCA and autoencoder neural networks.

Lab 9 - Contains a practice implementing your first Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (Reinforce) with PyTorch. 

**_Homeworks_**

Homework 0 - This assignment was to test the basic prerequisite for this class

Homework 1 - The goal of this assignment was to classify documents in a corpus. It invloved training a variety of tree-based models and evaluate each one using 5-fold cross-validation. Based on the best performing model, I ran inference on a test set and predicted the labels.

Homework 2 - Similar to HW 1 but made use of other features for feature exploration. Features like TFIDF, word embeddings provided by other packages like GloVe with gensim, or BERT are implenented in this HW. Also used 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the Neural Network.
